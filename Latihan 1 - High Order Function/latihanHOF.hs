-- (*) Define the length function using map and sum
length' xs = sum $ map ($1) xs

-- (*) What does map (+1) (map (+1) xs) do? Can you conclude anything in
-- general about properties of map f (map g xs), where f and g are arbitrary
-- functions?
addByTwo xs = map (+1) (map (+1) xs)
-- map (+1) (map (+1) xs) menambahkan angka 2 pada setiap elemen di list xs
-- Contoh : map (+1) (map (+1) [0,1,2]) = [2,3,4]
